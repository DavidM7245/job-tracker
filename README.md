Job Tracker App
Job Tracker App is a React-based application that helps users organize and monitor their job applications. It allows adding, editing, filtering, and sorting job entries, with persistent data storage using localStorage.

Getting Started
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Prerequisites
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed. If you don't have them installed, you can download and install them from Node.js official website.

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:
=======
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
>>>>>>> fc25b7c92ef025e828bb1d91e4621a9c8cf26613

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production.
=======
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!
>>>>>>> fc25b7c92ef025e828bb1d91e4621a9c8cf26613

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Note**: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back.
=======
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Features
Add new job applications with details like company name, position, and status.

Edit and update job applications.

Data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage, so the data persists even after a page refresh.
